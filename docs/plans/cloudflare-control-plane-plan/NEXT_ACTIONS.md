# Next Actions

## Current slice

- Current slice: `CFCP-A truth-sync and proof-root canonicalization`; #608 local-proof hardening merged, WP01 evidence refresh complete; #604 is closed without merge as superseded/conflicting and its branch/evidence are preserved only for audit.
- Current owner: `cloudflare-control-plane-plan`
- Current status: `in_progress`
- Final-tree scoped validation (2026-08-04): PR #608 merged to `main` as `5af4a1a92` after fresh full CI passed its product, security, and platform jobs. The merged local commands `npm --prefix infra/cloudflare run test:local-dev-workflow` (12 focused tests), `npm --prefix infra/cloudflare run lint`, `npm --prefix infra/cloudflare run proof:local-dev`, and `npm run lint:architecture -- --files infra/cloudflare/scripts/local-dev-proof.ts infra/cloudflare/tests/integration/local-dev-seeding-workflow.test.ts` pass. The proof command retains its result only through the canonical redacted NDJSON artifact under `output/cloudflare-control-plane-plan-proof/07-local-dev-seeding-and-fixtures/runs/<generated-run-id>`; it does not retain a raw stdout summary. This is local WP07 validation evidence only, not workpack closure. The successor is proof-only from current source after the real Wrangler/Workers-types dependency-resolution gap is cleared; it must not reuse or rebase PR #604.

## Ordered queue

| Order | Slice | Status | First-touch surface | Next action | Exit gate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 00-12 | Selected Cloudflare workpack | source-present / retained-proof-absent | selected workpack's first-touch surface | Reconcile the selected workpack's real dependencies first. For WP07, use the proof-only successor from current source after the Wrangler/Workers-types mismatch is resolved, then retain the focused bundle. Do not revive PR #604 or the stale private billing-domain import blocker. | The selected workpack has reproducible focused results, retained positive/negative/teardown evidence, and an explicit no-claim boundary. |

## Working rules

- Move exactly one row to `in_progress` when implementation starts.
- Do not start payment runtime slices while row 12 still lacks proof.
- Keep scaffold placeholders honest: `exists` is not the same as `validated`.
- Do not invent, shrink, or merge away test scope outside
  `REQUIRED_TEST_ASSERTION_MATRIX.md`.
- Keep `PLAN_EXECUTION_SCORECARD.md` aligned with real module and proof state.

# 17 Risk App Detection

Sources: [full scope plan](../v0-5-native-apps-full-scope-plan.md),
[test blueprint](../v0-5-native-apps-test-blueprint.md), and
`docs/expectations/ai.md`.

## Where We Are

Risk categories are discussed in planning docs, but native app risk detection is
not yet a proof-backed read model with confidence, source, policy routing, UI,
and no-content boundaries.

## Where We Want To Be

Risk app detection creates explainable candidates for parent review and policy
targets. It covers VPN/proxy, remote desktop, torrent/download, installer,
AI/chatbot, messaging/social/video, and unknown risk without directly enforcing.

## Scope

- Risk category contract and candidate state.
- Known app catalog risk mappings.
- Unknown name/publisher/hash-derived candidates.
- AI classification handoff when local AI proof exists.
- Parent override and display labels.
- Policy candidate and ask-parent routing.

## Touched Paths

- `packages/parent-domain/src/app-control-catalog*.ts`
- `packages/activity-domain/src/app-game*.ts`
- `packages/parent-domain/src/policy.ts`
- `fixtures/app/ui/app_risk_vpn.json`
- risk UI/evidence drawer tests when assigned.

## Tests And Proof

- Known VPN/proxy, remote desktop, torrent/download, and AI chatbot fixtures
  classify with evidence refs.
- Unknown executable with risk-like name remains candidate, not fact.
- Unknown publisher lowers confidence.
- Risk category cannot directly enforce.
- UI shows confidence, source evidence, and no content claim.

## AI Worker Checklist

Fill this before reporting `DONE` or PR-ready:

- [ ] Confirm source docs read: [folder README](../README.md), [source index](../source-index.md), [current snapshot](../current-app-snapshot.md), [full scope plan](../v0-5-native-apps-full-scope-plan.md), [platform deep dive](../v0-5-native-apps-platform-deep-dive.md), [test blueprint](../v0-5-native-apps-test-blueprint.md), [UI/UX guide](../ui-ux-requirements-guide.md), [main checklist](../implementation-checklist.md), and this workpack.
- [ ] Confirm this is native/installed-app scope, not browser pages, browser games, or game-specific product semantics unless the source docs explicitly route that handoff.
- [ ] Hub lock covers this workpack and exact implementation/docs paths.
- [ ] Existing app/game source layout inspected; no parallel app-control truth created.
- [ ] Before-state source snapshot recorded in `output/app-plan-proof/<workpack-id>/00-source-snapshot.md` or explicit docs-only N/A reason.
- [ ] Contracts updated first where this workpack changes behavior.
- [ ] Rust/service/portal parity updated only after TypeScript contracts exist.
- [ ] Raw evidence artifacts captured where applicable: inventory rows, process/package observations, foreground observations, session summaries, journal entries, SQLite/read-model rows, policy decisions, approval requests, authority-tier rows, and enforcement results.
- [ ] Tests/proof listed in this workpack and [test blueprint](../v0-5-native-apps-test-blueprint.md) are implemented or explicitly marked manual-required with reason.
- [ ] Required fixtures are present or N/A with reason for inventory, runtime, foreground, session, policy, enforcement, UI, malicious metadata, stale state, and manual-required state.
- [ ] Validation command outputs saved in the proof pack and summarized in [main checklist](../implementation-checklist.md).
- [ ] UI snapshots captured for every touched parent portal, child UX, policy authoring, approval, evidence drawer, dashboard, stale, degraded, or manual-required state; if no UI changed, `ui-not-applicable.md` records why.
- [ ] Security/no-claim negative proof captured where applicable: inventory is not usage, running is not foreground, foreground is not content, AI cannot enforce, manual-required cannot call adapters, and private paths/command lines do not leak.
- [ ] Manual platform proof captured for any claim stronger than observe-only, including OS/device version, authority tier, permission/enrollment setup, commands/UI steps, screenshots/logs, rollback, and cleanup.
- [ ] Platform limitations use capability status language: observe-only, permission-required, managed-device-required, admin/root-required, system-extension-required, supervised-device-required, manual-required, or not-claimed, with proof needed to move up.
- [ ] Evidence/proof artifact paths recorded in [main checklist](../implementation-checklist.md).
- [ ] Feature/expectation/product-checklist/README update decision recorded in [main checklist](../implementation-checklist.md).
- [ ] Known gaps, deferred items, and no-claim boundaries recorded before `DONE`.

## Manual-Required Gaps

Risk detection is advisory evidence. Parent policy and platform authority still
decide actions.
